  Official AI agent skills from the Expo team for building, deploying, upgrading, and debugging Expo apps.

## How It Works

Skills give AI agents focused Expo knowledge: when to use Expo APIs, how to structure common workflows, and which Expo, EAS, React Native, iOS, and Android constraints matter. Expo documentation, Expo CLI, and EAS CLI remain the source of truth; these skills help agents apply them correctly.

## Installation

For Claude Code or Codex, install the plugin so updates are handled by the official plugin marketplace. For Cursor, OpenCode, and other AI coding agents, use the skills CLI.

| Path | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| Plugin install | Claude Code or Codex, with updates handled by their official plugin marketplaces. |
| Skills CLI | Cursor, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, Cline, AMP, Factory Droid, Antigravity, Kiro CLI, and other AI coding agents. |

### Skills CLI

Install all Expo skills with the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh/docs/cli):

```text
npx skills@latest add expo/skills --skill '*'
```

This selects every Expo skill without selecting every agent. The CLI will still ask where to install them; to target one agent directly, add `--agent <agent>`.

For most agents, this is the only install command you need. Run it from the project root, then restart or refresh your agent session so it can discover the installed `SKILL.md` files.

### Claude Code Plugin

Install from the official Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```text
claude plugin install expo@claude-plugins-official
```

You can also run `/plugin install expo@claude-plugins-official` inside Claude Code.

### Codex Plugin

Install from the OpenAI-curated Codex marketplace:

```text
codex plugin add expo@openai-curated
```

You can also open `/plugins` in Codex and install `expo` from the OpenAI-curated marketplace.

## Updating

Claude Code and Codex plugin installs are updated through their official plugin marketplaces.

For skills CLI installs, update installed skills with:

```text
npx skills@latest update
```

To update a single Expo skill, pass its name:

```text
npx skills@latest update expo-router
```

## Try It

After installing, ask your agent Expo-specific questions like:

- "Build a native-feeling Expo Router screen with tabs, modals, and animations."
- "Set up Tailwind CSS v4 and NativeWind v5 in this Expo app."
- "Create an EAS workflow that builds previews on pull requests."
- "Help me upgrade this app to the latest Expo SDK."
- "Check whether this EAS Update rollout is healthy."

Agents choose the right skill from the task context and each skill's description.

## Skills Included

Skills come in two groups so the free vs paid boundary is clear. Each skill's description carries the same label, and every services skill opens with a costs/plan-limits note.

### Framework (open source)

Free, open-source Expo SDK and React Native skills.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `expo-router` | Expo Router screens, navigation, styling, animations, native tabs, and app UI patterns. |
| `expo-ui` | `@expo/ui` native components: universal cross-platform first, with SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose for platform-specific needs. |
| `expo-data-fetching` | API calls, React Query, SWR, caching, offline support, and Expo Router data loaders. |
| `expo-tailwind-setup` | Tailwind CSS v4, `react-native-css`, and NativeWind v5 setup. |
| `expo-dom` | Expo DOM components for gradually using web code in native apps. |
| `expo-module` | Expo native modules and views with Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, config plugins, and autolinking. |
| `expo-brownfield` | Adding Expo or React Native to an existing iOS or Android app. |
| `expo-dev-client` | Development clients (local builds are free; EAS Build/TestFlight is a paid step). |
| `expo-examples` | The `expo/examples` repo of `with-*` integrations to adapt or scaffold a new project from. |
| `expo-app-clip` | iOS App Clip targets, AASA files, associated domains, and Smart App Banners. |
| `expo-upgrade` | Expo SDK upgrades, dependency conflicts, deprecated packages, and cache cleanup. |

### Services & paid distribution

Skills that use paid Expo Application Services (EAS) or paid app-store distribution.

| Skill | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `eas-app-stores` | Production builds, App Store, Play Store, TestFlight, eas.json profiles, versioning, and store metadata. |
| `eas-hosting` | Deploying Expo websites and Expo Router API routes to EAS Hosting: secrets, custom domains, Cloudflare Workers. |
| `eas-workflows` | EAS Workflow YAML files and CI/CD automation. |
| `eas-observe` | EAS Observe setup and launch, route, event, and version metrics. |
| `eas-update-insights` | EAS Update health, crash rates, launch counts, payload size, and rollout gates. |

## Expo MCP Server

Skills teach an agent how Expo work gets done. The [Expo MCP server](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/ai/mcp/) gives it live access to actually do that work: read the latest Expo docs on demand, install compatible dependencies with `npx expo install`, trigger and monitor EAS builds and workflows, pull crash data from TestFlight, and screenshot a running app in the simulator.

The `expo` plugin bundles this MCP configuration, so Claude Code and Codex plugin installs wire it up automatically. For other agents, or to add it on its own, follow the [Expo MCP setup guide](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/ai/mcp/).

## FAQ

### Which AI coding agents are supported?

Use `npx skills@latest add expo/skills --skill '*'` for Cursor, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, Cline, AMP, Factory Droid, Antigravity, Kiro CLI, and similar AI coding tools.

### Should I install the skills or the plugin?

Use the plugin for Claude Code or Codex; it stays updated through the plugin marketplace. Use `npx skills@latest add expo/skills --skill '*'` for Cursor, OpenCode, and other AI coding agents.

### What is the source of truth?

Expo documentation, Expo CLI, and EAS CLI are the source of truth. These skills teach agents how to apply Expo guidance in real projects.
