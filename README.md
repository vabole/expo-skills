# Expo Skills

Official AI agent skills from the Expo team for building, deploying, and debugging robust Expo apps.

## Installation

We primarily use [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) at Expo, skills are fine-tuned for Opus models. But you can use these skills with any AI agent.

## Claude Code

Add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add expo/skills
```

Install the plugin:

```
/plugin install expo
```

## Cursor

**Install from GitHub**

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+Shift+J / Ctrl+Shift+J)
2. Navigate to `Rules & Command` → `Project Rules` → Add Rule → Remote Rule (GitHub)
3. Enter: `https://github.com/expo/skills.git`

**How it works:** Skills are automatically discovered and used by the agent based on context. When you ask questions about Expo development, the agent will automatically use the relevant skills (e.g., `building-ui`, `data-fetching`, `deployment`) based on the skill descriptions.

**Note:** Skills won't appear in the `/` slash command menu. The `/` menu in Cursor is for custom commands (stored in `.cursor/commands/`), not for skills. Skills work via auto-discovery - the agent uses them automatically when your questions match their descriptions.

**Verify installation:** After adding the Remote Rule, try asking the agent Expo-related questions like:
- "How do I build a UI with Expo Router?"
- "How do I make API calls in my Expo app?"
- "How do I deploy my Expo app to the App Store?"

If the skills are working, the agent will use the relevant skill content to answer your questions.

## Any agent

```
bunx skills add expo/skills
```

> This will extract the skills individually so you'll need to manually upgrade them.

## Usage telemetry & feedback

These skills send **anonymous** usage events so the Expo team can see how they're used and improve them. On first use a random ID is created locally at `~/.expo-skills/installation-id`; only a hash of it is sent. We never send source code, prompts, file paths, or personal data. Scripts are zero-dependency and run under Node or Bun.

- **Tracked in Claude Code:** when a skill is invoked (`skill_invoked`) and when it drives its first action (`skill_activated`).
- **Feedback:** every skill ends with an *Expo Skill Feedback* footer — a one-line command to send a quick rating + note.
- **Other agents (Codex, Cursor, …):** automatic tracking needs Claude Code hooks, so it's off there; feedback still works by running the bundled script.

Turn it off any time — the simplest way is to ask your agent: **"turn off Expo skills telemetry"** (it runs the bundled toggle, which writes `~/.expo-skills/opt-out` — a persistent switch that works regardless of how the agent was launched). For a global or CI opt-out, set an env var instead:

```bash
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1            # or: export EXPO_SKILLS_TELEMETRY=0
```

See the `skill-feedback` skill for full details, the event shape, and how to configure the PostHog project key.
