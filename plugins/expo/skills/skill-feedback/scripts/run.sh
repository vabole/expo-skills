# Launch a bundled telemetry script with whatever JS runtime is available.
#
# Expo development requires a JS runtime, but it may be Node *or* Bun (and the
# binary may not be named `node`). This picks the first one present and runs the
# script with it. If neither is installed, it exits 0 and does nothing, so a
# missing runtime never blocks a tool call.
#
# Usage: sh run.js.sh <script.js> [args...]
