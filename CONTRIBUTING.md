## Adding a new skill

Skills teach an agent how to do one Expo task well. Follow these guidelines so new
skills stay consistent with the rest of the marketplace.

### 1. Scaffold it with `skill-creator`

From Claude Code, run the `/skill-creator` skill to scaffold a new skill - and to edit, optimize,
or eval an existing one. It sets up the folder structure and helps you tune the `description` for
reliable triggering.

Skills live one level deep:

```
plugins/expo/skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md            # required
  references/         # optional, loaded on demand
  scripts/            # optional, reusable logic
  agents/openai.yaml  # Codex trigger metadata
```

### 2. Name it `expo-*` or `eas-*`

Names are lowercase kebab-case (max 64 chars). The prefix signals the free/paid boundary:

- **`expo-*`** - open-source framework skills: the Expo SDK, Expo Router, React Native, and
  local tooling. Examples: `expo-router`, `expo-dom`, `expo-module`, `expo-web-to-native`.
- **`eas-*`** - skills whose core purpose is a paid Expo Application Services product.
  Examples: `eas-hosting`, `eas-app-stores`, `eas-workflows`, `eas-observe`, `eas-simulator`.

Name after what users say, and prefer the real product or package name (e.g. `eas-hosting`,
not `expo-api-routes`). To rename an existing skill, `git mv` the directory (to preserve
history), update the frontmatter `name:`, and fix every reference (catalogs, `agents/openai.yaml`,
cross-links in other skills).

### 3. Decide free vs paid - and be strict about it

A skill belongs in **Services & paid distribution** only if its **core purpose requires a paid
EAS product** (EAS Build, Submit, Hosting, Update, Workflows, Observe, Simulator, …).

- A paid **Apple Developer or Google Play** account does **not** make a skill "paid" here - that
  is app-store distribution, not EAS. `expo-app-clip` is a framework skill even though shipping a
  Clip needs an Apple account.
- If authoring is free and only *deploying* is paid, it is usually still framework - unless the
  skill is fundamentally about the paid service. (`eas-hosting` is the deploy skill, so it is
  paid; free API-route authoring lives inside it.)
- Litmus test: *can a developer get the main value of this skill without paying Expo?*
  Yes → framework (`expo-*`). No → paid (`eas-*`).

### 4. Prefix the description, and add a costs note for paid skills

Every `description` opens with its category label:

- Framework: `Framework (OSS). <what it does and when to use it>`
- Paid: `EAS service (paid). <what it does and when to use it>`

Paid skills also open the `SKILL.md` **body** with a short callout:

```markdown
> **EAS service - costs apply.** <one line on what consumes the plan>. See https://expo.dev/pricing.
```

### 5. Write a description that triggers well

The `description` is how an agent decides to load the skill, so it matters more than any other field.

- **Max 1024 characters** (CI-enforced).
- Say **what it does** *and* **when to use it**, in the words users actually type ("turn a website
  into an app", "run on a cloud simulator", "ship to TestFlight").
- Use concrete package, command, and API names (`@expo/ui`, `eas deploy`, `+api.ts`) - but don't
  keyword-stuff with unrelated terms.
- When a sibling skill is easy to confuse with, add a `Not for …` clause (see `expo-ui` vs
  `expo-router`).

### 6. Keep it concise - context windows are the constraint

When a skill triggers, its whole `SKILL.md` loads into the agent's context. Shorter is better.

- The body is capped at **500 lines** (CI-enforced) - treat that as a ceiling, not a target.
- Move anything the agent needs only *sometimes* into `references/*.md` and link to it; references
  load on demand.
- Put reusable validation or fetching logic in `scripts/` instead of long inline command blocks.
- One skill = one job. If it grows two distinct triggers, split it (that is why `eas-hosting` and
  `eas-app-stores` are separate skills).

### 7. Add the Codex agent file

Add `agents/openai.yaml` with `display_name`, `short_description` (paid skills prefix it
`Paid EAS service.`), and a `default_prompt` that references the skill via `$<skill-name>`.

### 8. Register the skill in every catalog

Add it to the correct group (framework vs paid) in all of:

- `skills.sh.json`
- `plugins/expo/README.md` - both **When to Use** and **Skills Included**
- `plugins/expo/skills/README.md`
- `README.md`

### 9. Bump the plugin version

Bump `version` in **all three** manifests together - they must match each other and be greater
than `main`. CI enforces this.

- `plugins/expo/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `plugins/expo/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `plugins/expo/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`

### 10. Validate before opening a PR

```bash
claude plugin validate ./plugins/expo
bun scripts/check-skill-limits.ts
bun scripts/check-plugin-version-bump.ts origin/main
```

Also run `python3 -m json.tool <file>` on any JSON you edited, and if the skill ships `scripts/`,
run that skill's own validation.

### Conventions

- MIT license for every skill; use `@expo.io` or `@expo.dev` author emails.
- Keep `references/` next to the skill that uses them.
- Don't broaden a skill's scope or trigger intent when editing it - keep changes focused.
